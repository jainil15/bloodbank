          <div class="question"><h3 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Why Donate Blood?</h3></div>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; ">Every two seconds, someone in need of blood is counting on you. By donating blood, you have the power to
          save lives, support medical treatments, and ensure that hospitals are equipped to handle emergencies. Here
          are some key reasons why blood donation is crucial:

          Life-Saving Gift: Your blood donation can be a life-saving gift for accident victims, patients undergoing
          surgeries, individuals with chronic illnesses, and those with blood disorders.

          Medical Treatments: Blood is an essential component for various medical procedures, including organ
          transplants, cancer treatments, and childbirth-related complications. Your donation can provide hope and
          healing to those in critical conditions.

          Community Support: By donating blood, you actively contribute to the well-being of your community. You
          become a beacon of hope for patients and their families, helping to build a healthier and stronger society.

          Health Benefits: Blood donation not only helps others but also offers health benefits for the donors
          themselves. It stimulates the production of new blood cells, reduces the risk of heart diseases, and helps
          maintain overall well-being.</p>
